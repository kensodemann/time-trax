# Time Trax

This project is being used to develop a sample Angular2 application using the
Angular2 CLI. I also hope to use the Angular2 Material library for this.

Since some of the libraries used are in RC status I don't expect too many fundamental
changes to be required. The Material library is in Alpha at this time, so I expect
some issues there.

Milestones:

* get a base skeleton up and running
* add authentication
* add the project list and editor
* add the current timesheet and task editor
* add the time report
* add prior timesheet reporting
